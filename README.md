# GOV.UK Connect

This is a command line tool to help you connect to GOV.UK's infrastructure.

## Installation

To install:

```bash
sudo gem install govuk-connect
```

> If you use a Ruby version manager like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), you may find this only installs `govuk-connect` for a particular version of Ruby. Try installing outside of an rbenv-managed directory to fix this e.g. your home directory.
